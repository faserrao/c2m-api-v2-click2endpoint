# CRASH RECOVERY LOG - READ THIS FIRST
**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Time**: ~11:50 AM

## CRITICAL SITUATION SUMMARY
1. **What was working**: Click2Endpoint app (`app_hardcoded_v1.py`) was running perfectly at 10:47 AM, generating code files successfully
2. **What happened**: VS Code crashed while the app was running
3. **Current problem**: Streamlit buttons don't work - first button clicks, then subsequent buttons become unclickable with "circle with slash" cursor
4. **Root cause**: Unknown corruption after VS Code crash - possibly network binding issues, CSS pointer-events conflicts, or Streamlit state corruption

## VERIFIED WORKING STATE (Before Crash)
- **App file**: `streamlit_app/app_hardcoded_v1.py` 
- **Port**: 8502
- **Last generated code**: `/generated_code/c2m_jobs_single-doc-job-template_20250922_104703.py`
- **Features working**: 
  - Visual button selection for questions
  - Code generation (Python/JavaScript)
  - Mock server integration
  - Session logging

## ISSUES ENCOUNTERED
1. **Button Click Problem**:
   - First button in question works
   - Subsequent buttons show "no click" cursor (circle with slash)
   - Button labels disappear on hover
   - App crashes when trying to click non-working buttons

2. **Network Binding Issue**:
   - Streamlit binding to external IP (10.5.0.2) instead of localhost
   - Cannot connect to localhost:8502 even when app says it's running
   - `curl` cannot reach localhost or 127.0.0.1

## WHAT WE TRIED (in order)
1. ✅ Killed all processes multiple times
2. ✅ Checked Python environment (correct: `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin/python`)
3. ✅ Verified Streamlit version (1.28.1 - correct per requirements.txt)
4. ✅ Tried different ports (8501, 8502, 8503, 8888, 8889, 8890, 8891)
5. ✅ Cleared browser cache (user did this)
6. ✅ Tried different app versions:
   - `app_hardcoded_v1.py` (correct version but buttons broken)
   - `app.py` (old version)
   - `app_final.py` (had errors)
   - `app_v3.py` (old version)
   - `app_integrated.py` (very old version)
7. ✅ Created minimal test file (`test_buttons.py`) - SAME PROBLEM
8. ✅ Reinstalled Streamlit 1.28.1
9. ✅ Cleared all caches and temp files:
   - `rm -rf ~/.streamlit/*`
   - Deleted `__pycache__` and `*.pyc` files
10. ✅ Tried various Streamlit launch parameters:
    - `--server.enableCORS false`
    - `--server.enableXsrfProtection false`
    - `--theme.base light`
    - `--server.address localhost/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0`
    - `--global.developmentMode false`
    - `--server.fileWatcherType none`

## IMPORTANT FILES
- **Working app**: `streamlit_app/app_hardcoded_v1.py`
- **Test file created**: `test_buttons.py` (simple button test)
- **Config created**: `~/.streamlit/config.toml`
- **Requirements**: `requirements.txt` (specifies streamlit==1.28.1)

## NEXT STEPS AFTER REBOOT
1. **Use the manual backup** from last night (user mentioned this)
2. **Check if basic Streamlit works**: Run `test_buttons.py` first
3. **Run the backup version** of `app_hardcoded_v1.py`
4. **Verify network**: Ensure Streamlit binds to localhost, not external IP
5. **If still broken**: Consider that the macOS network stack might need reset

## DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS TO RUN AFTER REBOOT
```bash
# Check no stuck processes
ps aux | grep -E "streamlit|python.*app" | grep -v grep

# Verify Python environment
which python && python --version

# Test basic connectivity
curl -I http://localhost:8502

# Run minimal test
streamlit run test_buttons.py --server.port 8502 --server.address 127.0.0.1
```

## KEY INSIGHT
The issue progressed from "buttons don't work after first one" to "cannot reach site at all", suggesting progressive network/system corruption. A reboot should clear any stuck network states or zombie processes.

**USER HAS MANUAL BACKUP FROM LAST NIGHT - START WITH THAT VERSION**
