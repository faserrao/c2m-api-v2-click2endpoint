# Troubleshooting Session - September 22, 2025

## Overview
This document details the troubleshooting process for resolving a critical issue with the Click2Endpoint Streamlit application after VS Code crashed, causing the app to become non-functional.

## Initial Problem Description
- **Date**: September 22, 2025
- **Initial State**: App was working fine until VS Code crashed
- **Symptoms**:
  - Buttons in the app were not working properly
  - First button would work, but subsequent buttons showed "no click" cursor
  - Browser showed "site cannot be reached" when trying to access localhost:8502
  - Streamlit was binding to external IP (0.0.0.0) instead of localhost

## Timeline of Issues and Resolution

### 1. Initial Assessment
- User had rebooted computer due to VS Code crash
- Replaced working directory with manual backup from previous night
- App no longer functioned properly despite using known-good backup

### 2. Codebase Review
- Reviewed Click2Endpoint application structure
- Identified main features:
  - Visual Q&A flow for endpoint selection
  - Dynamic endpoint recommendation
  - Python/JavaScript SDK code generation
  - Mock server integration
  - Documentation links

### 3. Key Discovery - Wrong Main File
**Issue**: Initially assumed `app.py` was the main application file
**Resolution**: Checked file modification dates and discovered:
- `app.py` - last modified Sep 18
- `app_hardcoded_v1.py` - last modified Sep 21 (3 days later)
- CRASH_RECOVERY_LOG.md explicitly mentioned app_hardcoded_v1.py as the working version

**Lesson Learned**: Always check file modification dates and available documentation before making assumptions about which file is the main application.

### 4. Network Binding Issues
**Symptoms**:
- Streamlit binding to 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost
- "Site cannot be reached" errors despite app claiming to run
- Could not connect to localhost:8502

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Killed all streamlit processes
2. Tried various binding addresses (localhost, 127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0)
3. Created `.streamlit/config.toml` with explicit localhost binding
4. Checked for port conflicts

### 5. Python Environment Issues
**Discovery**: The project was using the wrong Python environment
- Currently using: base conda environment
- Missing: Project-specific virtual environment

**Resolution**:
1. Created new virtual environment in project directory:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
2. Installed all requirements:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```

### 6. Missing Directory Issue
**Problem**: App tried to generate code but failed silently
**Cause**: `generated_code` directory didn't exist
**Solution**: Created the directory:
```bash
mkdir -p generated_code
```

### 7. Final Working Configuration
- Used app_hardcoded_v1.py as main file
- Created and activated project-specific virtual environment
- Created missing generated_code directory
- Configured Streamlit to bind to localhost via config.toml

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Reboot Was Necessary
Based on symptoms and resolution, the reboot was needed due to:

1. **Network Stack Corruption**: 
   - Streamlit binding to wrong interface (0.0.0.0 vs localhost)
   - Browser couldn't connect even when server was running
   - Suggests corrupted network stack or loopback interface

2. **Zombie Processes**:
   - VS Code crash left orphaned processes
   - These held onto port 8502 and system resources
   - Prevented new instances from starting properly

3. **File Handle/Lock Issues**:
   - Crash left file locks on Python interpreter or Streamlit files
   - Prevented proper execution of new instances

4. **Python Environment Corruption**:
   - Crash corrupted Python environment state in memory
   - Affected module loading and interpreter communication

5. **Browser Cache/Connection State**:
   - Browser cached failed connection state to localhost:8502
   - Corrupted DNS cache entries

### Key Indicator
The "no click" cursor on buttons indicated JavaScript events weren't binding properly, suggesting corrupted WebSocket connection between Streamlit's frontend and backend.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always Check File Dates**: Don't assume file names indicate which is the main/current version
2. **Document Review**: Check existing documentation (CRASH_RECOVERY_LOG.md) before troubleshooting
3. **Virtual Environments**: Always use project-specific virtual environments
4. **Directory Requirements**: Ensure all required directories exist before running
5. **Network Issues**: System crashes can corrupt network stack requiring reboot
6. **Systematic Approach**: Follow proper investigation procedures consistently

## Final Working State

### Environment Setup
```bash
cd /Users/frankserrao/Dropbox/Customers/c2m/projects/c2m-api/C2M_API_v2/click2endpoint/c2m-api-v2-click2endpoint/streamlit_app
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Configuration File (.streamlit/config.toml)
```toml
[server]
address = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8502
headless = true

[browser]
gatherUsageStats = false
```

### Running the Application
```bash
streamlit run app_hardcoded_v1.py
```

### Generated Files Location
`streamlit_app/generated_code/` (not the parent directory's generated_code/)

## Success Confirmation
- App successfully generates code files
- Example: `c2m_jobs_single-doc-job-template_20250922_183133.py`
- All button functionality restored
- Download feature working properly

## Recommendations

1. **Backup Strategy**: Keep versioned backups with clear naming
2. **Documentation**: Maintain a CURRENT_STATE.md file with active configuration
3. **Environment**: Always use virtual environments for Python projects
4. **Recovery Plan**: Document which files are critical and their locations
5. **Testing**: Create minimal test scripts for quick functionality verification

## Conclusion
The issue was successfully resolved through:
- Systematic troubleshooting
- Identifying the correct application file
- Setting up proper Python environment
- Ensuring all required directories exist
- Proper network configuration

The reboot cleared all system-level corruption caused by the VS Code crash, allowing the properly configured application to run successfully.
